This prototype was crafted as the culmination of my coursework in game development fundamentals during my master's degree. The primary goal was to design a 2D game incorporating a comprehensive array of technical implementations covered throughout the course. Some of the key elements integrated into this prototype include:

- Parallax Backgrounds: Implemented to create depth and dynamism within the game environment.
- 2D Movement Systems and Collisions: Leveraged for character movement and interaction within the game world.
- Camera System: Employed to manage the player's view and enhance gameplay experience.
- Object Pooling: Utilized for optimizing memory and enhancing performance.
- Animation Controllers: Integrated for character animations and in-game responsiveness.

This project served as a hands-on exploration of diverse technical aspects crucial to 2D game development. The aim was to showcase a synthesis of these elements while creating an engaging game experience.

Moreover, this game utilizes assets from the Synty Studio Cyberpunk package, originally designed for 3D environments. By adapting the 2D systems to function within a 3D space and utilizing an orthographic camera restricted to movement solely in the XY plane, the gameplay experience retains a 2D perspective within a 3D environment.

This project aims to showcase the adaptation of 2D mechanics within a 3D setting, blurring the lines between the traditional distinctions of 2D and 3D gaming experiences.

This repository contains the complete Unity project encompassing all necessary assets to run the game within the Unity editor. Please note that this is a prototype, serving as a demonstration of various technical implementations learned during my master's degree program.

While functional, many systems within the game are open to improvement and refinement. It's important to acknowledge that this project serves as a foundation for further development and enhancement.

My aspiration is to continuously improve this project until it evolves into a comprehensive, fully realized experience suitable for distribution, potentially even as a free offering on storefronts. Your feedback and contributions are welcomed and appreciated as I strive to transform this prototype into a polished, engaging game.

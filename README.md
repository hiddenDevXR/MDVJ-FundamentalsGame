# Game Development Fundamentals Project

This prototype was crafted as the culmination of my coursework in game development fundamentals during my master's degree. The primary goal was to design a 2D game incorporating a comprehensive array of technical implementations covered throughout the course. Some of the key elements integrated into this prototype include:

Parallax Backgrounds: Implemented to create depth and dynamism within the game environment.
2D Movement Systems and Collisions: Leveraged for character movement and interaction within the game world.
Camera System: Employed to manage the player's view and enhance gameplay experience.
Object Pooling: Utilized for optimizing memory and enhancing performance.
Animation Controllers: Integrated for character animations and in-game responsiveness.
This project served as a hands-on exploration of diverse technical aspects crucial to 2D game development. The aim was to showcase a synthesis of these elements while creating an engaging game experience.
